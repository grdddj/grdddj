### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jiri, a software developer from Prague.

I am interested in all things about `Bitcoin`, programming and data-science. My favourite language by far is `python` (even though `Rust` starts to come close).

### Work projects
I am currently working for [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io) as a firmware developer on the [trezor-firmware repository](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware).

For the purposes of `firmware` repository, I also created two standalone `python` tools, that we used for decreasing the size of our binary. Both of these are public packages installable by `pip`: 
- `binsize` - analyzing the size of symbols from .elf files - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/binsize)
- `upysize` - linter to find optimizations to micropython code to reduce its size - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/upysize)

### Personal projects
When I have time, I like working on hobby personal projects. I have done countless smaller or bigger scripts/applications and each one taught me something new.
Some of the most notable are:

- `OrdSimilarity` - https://ordsimilarity.com/ - a search engine for similar ordinals pictures - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/similar-ordinals)
- `BtcStatts` - https://btcstatts.com/ - statistics about BTC ordinals - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/ordinals-statistics)
- `MusilBlockchain` - https://www.musil-blockchain.cz/ - my personal website about blockchain technology from 2018 - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/My-blockchain-page)
- `GrdddjDashboard` - https://grdddj.eu/ - showing some of the smaller website applications in one directory
- `ChessRobot` - [video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grdddj/My-codebase/master/Python/Chess%20Robot/ChessRobot_in_action.mp4) - application playing lightning-speed chess on the screen against an opponent - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/My-codebase/tree/master/Python/Chess%20Robot)
- `CalculatorChat` - GUI acting both as a calculator and full-featured Messenger-like chat service - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/My-codebase/tree/master/Python/GUI%20-%20CalcJokeChat)

- `CryptoMarketWatcher` - app sending notifications about cryptocurrency prices reaching certain levels - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/My-codebase/tree/master/Python/Market%20Watcher)
- `PiskvorkyInTerminal` - my first bigger application, from 2018, when I was starting learning Java and programming in general - [repository](https://github.com/grdddj/My-codebase/tree/master/Java/Java%20-%20Pi%C5%A1kvorky%20OutputWindow)
